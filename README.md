This Lua library is a s3 uploading utility for the ngx_lua nginx module:

Synopsis
========

```
    lua_package_path "/path/to/lua-resty-s3/lib/?.lua;;";
    
    server {
        location /test {
            content_by_lua '
                local s3 = require "resty.s3"
                local s3, err = s3:new("aws-id", "aws-key")
                
                final_url, err = s3:upload_url("http://lorempixel.com/400/200/", "examplebucket", "lorempixel400x200")`

Methods
=======

All of the commands return either something that evaluates to true on success, or `nil` and an error message on failure.

new
---
`syntax: s3, err = s3:new(id, key)`

Creates an uploading object. In case of failures, returns `nil` and a string describing the error.

generate_auth_headers
---------------------
`syntax: s3, err = s3:generate_auth_headers(content_type, destination)`

`syntax: s3, err = s3:generate_auth_headers("binary/octet-stream", "/examplebucket/lorempixel400x200")`

Creates the headers needed for authentication with amazon. In case of failures, returns `nil` and a string describing the error.

try_upload
----------
`syntax: s3, err = s3:try_upload(content, destination, content_type, headers)`

`syntax: s3, err = s3:try_upload([[<h1>Hello</h1>]], "/examplebucket/hello", "text/html", headers)`

Attempts to upload content to s3. In case of failures, returns `nil` and a string describing the error.

upload_url
----------
`syntax: final_url, err = s3:upload_url(file_url, bucket, object_name, check_for_existance, add_to_existance)`

`syntax: final_url, err = s3:upload_url("http://lorempixel.com/400/200/", "/examplebucket/", "lorempixel400x200")`

Attempts to upload content to s3 from the url set by file_url and the id/key set with new(). If object_name is supplied then that will be the name of the new file, otherwise it will hash the file_url to create a unique key for it.

Callbacks for checking something before uploading [again], and after uploading can be supplied in check_for_existance and add_to_existance. Each will be called with the object_name or a hash.

```
local uploaded_content = ngx.shared.uploaded_content

check = function (name)
  ok, err = uploaded_content:get(name)
  if ok then return true end
end

add = function (name)
  ok, err = uploaded_content:add(name)
  return true
end

final_url, err = s3:upload_url("http://lorempixel.com/400/200/", "/examplebucket/", "lorempixel400x200", check, add)
```

In case of success, returns the new url. In case of errors, returns `nil` with a string describing the error.

extract_urls
------------
`syntax: s3, err = s3:extract_urls(file_content, bucket)`

`syntax: s3, err = s3:extract_urls([[<ahref="www.google.com"><img src="http://lorempixel.com/output/city-q-g-640-480-4.jpg" /></a>]], "/examplebucket/")`

Attempts to find and upload urls from within source. In case of failures, returns `nil` and a string describing the error.

upload_content
--------------
`syntax: s3, err = s3:upload_content(file_content, bucket, object_name, check_for_existance, add_to_existance)`

`syntax: s3, err = s3:upload_content([[<ahref="www.google.com"><img src="http://lorempixel.com/output/city-q-g-640-480-4.jpg" /></a>]], "/examplebucket/", "city.jpg")`

Attempts to upload content to s3 (handles all auth automatically). In case of failures, returns `nil` and a string describing the error.

Installation
============
You can install it with luarocks `luarocks install lua-resty-s3`

Otherwise you need to configure the lua_package_path directive to add the path of your lua-nginx-loggin source to ngx_lua's LUA_PATH search path, as in

```nginx
    # nginx.conf
    http {
        lua_package_path "/path/to/lua-resty-s3/lib/?.lua;;";
        ...
    }
```

This package also requires the luasocket and xxhash packages to be installed http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luasocket/ , https://github.com/mah0x211/lua-xxhash
```
luarocks install luasocket
```

Ensure that the system account running your Nginx ''worker'' proceses have
enough permission to read the `.lua` file.
